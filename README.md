# Geolocation Tutorial - Get User Location using Vanilla JS

If you often use maps on your website, you may be interested in getting the geolocation of your user's location. In this tutorial, we go over how to find the latitude and longitude of your user after asking permission. Once we have those coordinates, we use an open-source map to plot their exact location within a visual interface.

This tutorial uses Leaflet + OpenStreetMap but you can use the same methods to integrate Google maps.
